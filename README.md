# Plane-of-array-irradiance-analysis-for-Uganda
This project was aimed to develope a model to predict plane of array irradiance for Uganda and compare it with other developed models basing on root mean square deviation and mean bias deviation
At the end if this project I was able to obtain the ootimum surface tilt and surface azimuth for different regions of Uganda
And Uganda as region. For more information u can read or download the word document in this repository.
